# Spike Pagination Example

An example of how to paginate remote data in spike. This example uses the Carrot Creative staff API with spike-records and the most basic javascript possible. For a more robust implementation, I'd recommend using a front-end framework like react or vue.

## Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is at version >= `6`
- `npm i spike -g`
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `spike watch` or `spike compile`
